### Arrays

Add support for arrays to Egg by adding the following three functions to the top scope: `array(...values)` to construct an array containing the argument values, `length(array)` to get an array’s length, and `element(array, n)` to fetch the n<sup>th</sup> element from an array.

```
// Modify these definitions...

topScope.array = "...";

topScope.length = "...";

topScope.element = "...";

run(`
do(define(sum, fun(array,
     do(define(i, 0),
        define(sum, 0),
        while(<(i, length(array)),
          do(define(sum, +(sum, element(array, i))),
             define(i, +(i, 1)))),
        sum))),
   print(sum(array(1, 2, 3))))
`);
// → 6
```

### Closure

The way we have defined `fun` allows functions in Egg to reference the surrounding scope, allowing the function’s body to use local values that were visible at the time the function was defined, just like JavaScript functions do.

The following program illustrates this: function `f` returns a function that adds its argument to `f`’s argument, meaning that it needs access to the local scope inside f to be able to use binding a.

```
run(`
do(define(f, fun(a, fun(b, +(a, b)))),
   print(f(4)(5)))
`);
// → 9
```

Go back to the definition of the `fun` form and explain which mechanism causes this to work.

### Comments

It would be nice if we could write comments in Egg. For example, whenever we find a hash sign (#), we could treat the rest of the line as a comment and ignore it, similar to // in JavaScript.

We do not have to make any big changes to the parser to support this. We can simply change `skipSpace` to skip comments as if they are whitespace so that all the points where `skipSpace` is called will now also skip comments. Make this change.

```
// This is the old skipSpace. Modify it...
function skipSpace(string) {
  let first = string.search(/\S/);
  if (first == -1) return "";
  return string.slice(first);
}

console.log(parse("# hello\nx"));
// → {type: "word", name: "x"}

console.log(parse("a # one\n   # two\n()"));
// → {type: "apply",
//    operator: {type: "word", name: "a"},
//    args: []}
```

### Fixing scope

Currently, the only way to assign a binding a value is `define`. This construct acts as a way both to define new bindings and to give existing ones a new value.

This ambiguity causes a problem. When you try to give a nonlocal binding a new value, you will end up defining a local one with the same name instead. Some languages work like this by design, but I’ve always found it an awkward way to handle scope.

Add a special form `set`, similar to `define`, which gives a binding a new value, updating the binding in an outer scope if it doesn’t already exist in the inner scope. If the binding is not defined at all, throw a `ReferenceError` (another standard error type).

The technique of representing scopes as simple objects, which has made things convenient so far, will get in your way a little at this point. You might want to use the `Object.getPrototypeOf` function, which returns the prototype of an object. Also remember that scopes do not derive from `Object.prototype`, so if you want to call `hasOwnProperty` on them, you have to use this clumsy expression: `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(scope, name);`

```
specialForms.set = (args, scope) => {
  // Your code here.
};

run(`
do(define(x, 4),
   define(setx, fun(val, set(x, val))),
   setx(50),
   print(x))
`);
// → 50
run(`set(quux, true)`);
// → Some kind of ReferenceError
```
